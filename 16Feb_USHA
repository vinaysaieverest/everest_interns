Disadvantages
many conflicts if on same branchâ€”
no independency if on one branch whole. 3groups
Master-bug less code/stable code
we dont commit direclty to master because it is production environment and deployed from here


so we need 3 different areas (branches)
1.so we create a branch payment.  # git branch payments
2.and then checking out to that branch #git checkout payments

git checkout -b payments
